    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a budding software engineer studying at Moringa School. I hope to get into the Sofatware Engineering
      field/career once I graduate<strong>-with flying colors ofcourse!.</strong>Creating this website is my way of practising what 
      I have learnt so far and also a chance to improve and add to my skills.What I am a showcasing today with this 
      website is what I have learnt from my first week at Moringa School, coupled by what I learnt from both Mr.Google 
      and Ms Youtube!.I am a solution-oriented individual and I hope tech will help me provide lasting and manageable 
      solutions to the problems that have plagued both my country Kenya and other countries especially in Africa for 
      decades.

      <h3>Pass Time Activities</h3>
      <p>
      I enjoy reading, infact,<em>I love reading.</em> favourite genres would be motivational/self-help books, followed by
      psychological thrillers and contemporary fiction.I enjoy the outdoors too so you'll most probably find me 
      riding a bicycle or taking a walk when I am not at home or working.I also have an interest in Psychology:how the 
      human brain works is pretty cool! I hope to make a positive change in the mental health sector through tech.
